<h1>Hear from my customers</h1>

<h2>So Original!</h2>
<br>
<p>We had her come do our wedding in Orem and while our ceremony and the crepe bar that followed
  were far from original, the photos Autumn captured on that special day were.</p>
<br><br>
<h2>Sensitive</h2>
<br>
<p>I wanted someone to come out and professionally photograph my horse's funeral. She was so considerate
  of us and what we needed in regard to privacy in those moments. They came out beautiful, exactly
  as Martha would have wanted.</p>
  <br><br>
<h2>Very Versatile</h2>
<br>
<p>We asked her to come into our home to take newborn photos of our baby Emma. The nursery space was small
  but she was able to set up all sorts of lighting equiptment so get the most perfect photos of our girl
  in her antique crib (it belonged to my grandmother and is likely a HUGE safety hazard). 10/10
  would recommend</p>
